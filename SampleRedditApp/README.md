Assignment:

The Twitter API provides a stream endpoint that delivers a roughly 1% random sample of publicly available Tweets in real- time. In this assignment you will build an application that utilizes that endpoint and processes incoming tweets to compute various statistics. We'd like to see this as a .NET Core or .NET Framework project, but otherwise feel free to use any libraries or frameworks you want to accomplish this task.
The Twitter API v2 sampled stream endpoint provides a random sample of approximately 1% of the full tweet stream. Your app should consume this sample stream and keep track of the following:
• Total number of tweets received
• Top 10 Hashtags
Your app should also provide some way to report these values to a user (periodically log to terminal, return from RESTful web service, etc). If there are other interesting statistics you’d like to collect, that would be great. There is no need to store this data in a database; keeping everything in-memory is fine. That said, you should think about how you would persist data if that was a requirement.
It’s very important that when the application receives a tweet it does not block statistics reporting while performing tweet processing. Twitter regularly sees 5700 tweets/second, so your app may likely receive 57 tweets/second, with higher burst rates. The app should process tweets as concurrently as possible to take advantage of available computing resources. While this system doesn’t need to handle the full tweet stream, you should think about how you could scale up your app to handle such a high volume of tweets.
While designing and developing this application, you should keep SOLID principles in mind. Although this is a code challenge, we are looking for patterns that could scale and are loosely coupled to external systems / dependencies. In that same theme, there should be some level of error handling and unit testing. The submission should contain code that you would consider production ready.

Notes:

I was unable to obtain a Twitter API key so I performed a similar exercise with the Reddit API subbing Subreddits instead of hashtags.

I recognize this task was somewhat simpler than parsing hashtags out of a tweet body.  Had I been working with Tweets I would have used the following Regex to accomplish that:
